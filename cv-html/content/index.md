## {{< icon bi-exclamation-circle>}} Professional Summary

**tl;dr:** *After graduating from University in 2009 I worked in web development for several years, eventually moving to
back-end/full-stack (ad-tech). I worked for many years leading development of a large full-stack
fintech application with Go and Angular, and later moved into a Go developer position maintaining european
payment gateways at Form3. After leaving Form3 I transitioned to my current position at Circuit, doing back-end Typescript development,
having learned the language in my time as a full-stack developer.*

**Most Recent positions:** 

At Circuit, I work on the back-end of the Route Planner and Teams applications. This involves Typescript/Node.js development, 
debugging issues, integrating external systems and some cloud/GCP infrastructure work. Circuit is a route planner
app used by a large number of drivers globally. Our objective is to save drivers time by producing highly optimised 
routes for their deliveries. We also support dispatchers with tools to distribute routes between drivers and so on. 
An example of the sort of project I'd be working on currently is improving delivery estimates by enriching our 
data with third party sources, in view of reducing failed deliveries.

At FORM3 I worked on European payment service gateways. My Role was primarily back-end development in Go,
including general feature development, maintenance and debugging issues. 
This system was a distributed payment processing platform using queues, APIs and relational databases.
In my time at FORM3 our largest project was to upgrade the SEPA gateways to support the latest ISO20022 maintenance release. This was somewhat challenging
as we would have to support both new and old message formats for several months, and the gateways had to be refactored
significantly to allow for this to happen. Ultimately the project concluded without any incidents.
After just over a year I was affected by a substantial downsizing of the European payments team and accepted redundancy of my position.

At Fraugster I was the first member of a new team responsible for building out the front-end (TypeScript/Angular), back-end (Go) and
infrastructure (K8s) for our "dashboard" project. The objective was to give customers analytics and configuration tools to introspect 
and configure their integration.
This meant creating systems for processing time-series data, raw data storage/life-cycle management, tools for writing business rules
and simulating them across historic data, user management and so on. This was effectively a micro-service architecture deployed to K8s using gRPC and queues for 
inter-service communication.
Over the course of 6+ years I continued to develop this project as well as taking on more management responsibilities,
eventually moving from full-stack developer to engineering manager. However, despite this role change
I still spent the majority of my time working directly on the project - coding, debugging, designing new features, running the 
scrum process and so on. After a few years in management I moved back into a tech-lead role as I felt this was a better fit for my skills and aspirations.
Unfortunately Fraugster did not survive the post-covid funding drought and went into administration, causing me to move on.

## {{< icon bi-stars>}} Core Skills

#### {{< icon bi-code>}} Languages

* **Go** - 9+ years. My favorite language to work with.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript** - 10+ years JS, 8+ years TypeScript. Both front-end (Angular) and back-end.
* **PHP** - 5-6 years experience with an emphasis on OOP, reusable components and clean code. I'm no longer interested in developing with PHP as I feel Go solves many of the same problems more effectively.

#### {{< icon bi-plug>}} Systems

* **Relational Databases** (Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB) - 10+ years. Focusing on larger databases, scaling and performance from both a development and operations perspective. Currently working mostly with Postgres.
* **Search** (Elasticsearch) - Implementing elaborate search functionality for simulating business rules across large datasets as well as more standard search applications.
* **Queues** (Kafka, others) - Currently using Kafka for most queue applications, but have used many others in the past.
* **Caches** (Redis, Memcache etc.) - Multiple years experience with various key-value type caches.
* **Non-relational Databases/Nosql** (Cassandra 2.x, MongoDB, others) - Datastax trained (Cassandara administration training), although I haven't touched it for years.

#### {{< icon bi-terminal>}} Transferable

* **Programming** - Knowledgeable in design patterns and API design.
* **Distributed Systems** - Many years experience working with and building resilient, performant distributed systems.
* **CI/CD** (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) - Experienced building pipelines for testing and delivery of software.
* **Testing** - Experienced in automated testing and continuous integration/delivery on the front and back-end, including test-first approaches.
* **Infrastructure** (Kubernetes, AWS, GCP) - Experience in automated provisioning and deployment for production and development infrastructure .
* **Monitoring** (Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana and Sentry) - Broad experience integrating observability systems.
* **Markup** (HTML, XML, YAML, CSS, SCSS etc.) - Many years working with web markup languages, and in particular XML due to its prevalence in SEPA payment schemes.
* **AI** (OpenAI, AssemblyAI) - Increasingly I've been using AI to solve problems related to natural language processing (e.g. transcription, deriving meaning from, or categorising unstructured data).
* **Version control** (Git) - Lots of Git.
* **Linux** - Competent working with Linux servers (Debian and CentOS mainly).

## {{< icon bi-person-raised-hand>}} Personal

Outside of work I love to write music and build things (software and physical). I have been into 3D printing and CAD for several years
and have recently started learning CAM and CNC machining. I also enjoy electrical engineering and working with microcontrollers, but I'm not very good at it. 
As a side-project I run a website that facilitates collaborative audio transcription for a tin-pot radio station that
stopped broadcasting 20 years ago. This allows people to search and submit transcriptions in return for charitable donations
to their chosen cause, and is considered an essential service for literally almost dozens of people.

I just recently relocated back to the UK after spending 7 years living in Berlin, Germany. Berlin continues to be
one of my favorite places in the world. After initially moving back to the South West, we have since moved to the
Midlands where we plan to continue to live for the foreseeable future.
