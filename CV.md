**tl;dr:** *After graduating from University in 2009 I worked in web development for several years, eventually moving to back-end/full-stack roles (ad-tech). In my most recent roles I have been leading development of a large full-stack fin-tech application with Go and Angular, and subsequently moved into a senior Go developer role maintaining european payment gateways at Form3.*

**In Detail:**

*Most Recent positions:* 

*At FORM3 I work on European payment service gateways. My Role is primarily back-end development in Go, including general feature development, maintenance and debugging issues. This system was a distributed payment processing platform using a lot of queues, APIs and relational databases.*
*In my time at FORM3 our largest project was to upgrade the SEPA gateways to support the latest ISO20022 maintenance release. This was somewhat challenging as we would have to support both new and old message formats for several months, and the gateways had to be refactored significantly to allow for this to happen. Ultimately the project concluded without any incidents.*

*At Fraugster I was the first member of a new team responsible for building out the front-end (TypeScript/Angular), back-end (Go) and
infrastructure (K8s) for our "dashboard" project. The objective was to give customers analytics and configuration tools to introspect 
and configure their integration.
This meant creating systems for processing time-series data, raw data storage/life-cycle management, tools for writing business rules
and simulating them across historic data, user management and so on. This was effectively a micro-service architecture deployed to K8s using gRPC and queues for 
inter-service communication.*
*Over the course of 6+ years I continued to develop this project as well as taking on more management responsibilities,
eventually moving from full-stack developer to engineering manager. However, despite this role change
I still spent the majority of my time working directly on the project - coding, debugging, designing new features, running the 
scrum process and so on. After a few years in management I moved back into a tech-lead role as I felt this was a better fit for my skills and aspirations.*

*At Travelaudience (Amadeus) I worked primarily as a back-end Go developer on core ad-serving products. Additionally performing a substantial amount of work to maintain and improve orchestration 
tools (writing Ansible roles, ensuring applications were packaged correctly etc). However, 
I didn't stay in this role very long as I didn't find the travel industry to be particularly inspiring.*

## Core Skills

### Languages

* **Go** - 8+ years. The main language I use at work and for personal projects.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript** - 10+ years JS 6+ years TypeScript. Primarily front-end work (Angular).
* **PHP** - 5-6 years experience with an emphasis on OOP, reusable components and clean code. I'm no longer interested in developing with PHP as I feel Go solves many of the same problems more effectively.

### Systems

* **Relational Databases** (Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB) - 10+ years. Focusing on larger databases, scaling and performance from both a development and operations perspective. Currently working mostly with Postgres.
* **Non-relational Databases/Nosql** (Cassandra 2.x, MongoDB, others) - Datastax trained (Cassandara administration training), although I haven't touched it for years.
* **Search** (Elasticsearch) - Implementing elaborate search functionality for simulating business rules across large datasets as well as more standard search applications.
* **Queues** (Kafka, others) - Currently using Kafka for most queue applications, but have used many others in the past.
* **Caches** (Redis, Memcache etc.) - Multiple years experience with various key-value type caches.

### Transferable

* **Programming** - Knowledgeable in design patterns and API design. Believer in software craftsmanship.
* **Distributed Systems** - Many years experience working with and building resilient, performant distributed systems.
* **CI/CD** (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) - Experienced building pipelines for testing and delivery of software.
* **Testing** - Experienced in automated testing and continuous integration/delivery on the front and back-end, including test-first approaches.
* **Infrastructure** (Kubernetes, AWS, GCP) - Experience in automated provisioning and deployment for production and development infrastructure .
* **Monitoring** (Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana and Sentry) - Broad experience integrating observability systems.
* **Markup** (HTML, XML, YAML, CSS, SCSS etc.) - Many years working with web markup languages, and in particular XML due to its prevalence in SEPA payment schemes.
* **AI** (OpenAI, AssemblyAI) - Increasingly I've been using AI to solve problems related to natural langage processing (e.g. transcription, deriving meaning from, or categorising unstructured data).
* **Version control** (Git) - Lots of Git.
* **Linux** - Competent working with Linux servers (Debian and CentOS mainly).

## Personal

Outside of work I love to write music and build things (software and physical). I have been into 3D printing and CAD for several years
and have recently started learning CAM and CNC machining. I also enjoy electrical engineering and working with microcontrollers, but I'm not very good at it. 
As a side-project I run a website that facilitates collaborative audio transcription for a tin-pot radio station that
stopped broadcasting 20 years ago. This allows people to search and submit transcriptions in return for charitable donations
to their chosen cause, and is considered an essential service for literally almost dozens of people.

I just recently relocated back to the UK after spending 7 years living in Berlin, Germany. Berlin continues to be
one of my favorite places in the world. After initially moving back to the South West, we have since moved to the
Midlands where we plan to continue to live for the forseeable future.
