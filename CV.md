Stefan Warman :: Curriculm Vitae
=============

* **Date of Birth:** 1986
* **Nationality:** British
* **Current Location:** Bristol, UK
* **Email:** stefan.warman [at] gmail.com
* **Github:** warmans

**tl;dr:** *After graduating from University in 2009 I worked in web development for several years, eventually moving to backend/full-stack roles (ad-tech). For the past
6 years I have been leading development of a large full-stack fin-tech application with Go and Angular.*

**In Detail:**

*From most recent to least:* 

*At Fraugster I was the first member of a new team responsible for building out the frontend (Typescript/Angular), backend (Go) and
infrastructure (K8s) for a new frontend project. The objective was to give customers analytics and configuration options beyond a simple API.
This meant creating systems for processing time series data, raw data storage/life-cycle management, tools for writing business rules
and simulating them across historic data, user management and so on.*
*Over the course of 6+ years I have continued to develop this project as well as taking on more management responsibilities,
eventually changing my role from full-stack developer to engineering manager. However, despite this role change
I still spent the majority of my time working directly on the project - coding, debugging, designing new features, running the 
scrum process and so on. After a few years in this role I wanted to move back to development full
time and changed my position to one with technical leadership aspects but mostly development responsibilities.*

*At Travelaudience I work primarily as a back-end Go developer on core adserving products. Additionally, I do a
substantial amount of work to maintain and improve orchestration tools (writing Ansible roles, ensuring apps are
packaged correctly etc). However, I didn't stay in this role very long as I didn't find the travel industry to 
be particularly inspiring.*

*At Switch I worked in the majority of the technical departments contributing to core adserving products,
big data systems, infrastructure and R&D of new products/services. In doing so I have learned a lot about
the digital advertising industry and enjoy the challenges presented by data-heavy, high volume systems.*

### Personal

Outside of work I love to write music and build things (software and physical). I have been into 3d printing for several years 
and have recently started working with CNC machines. I also enjoy electrical engineering, although I have a long road ahead in this 
area. As a side-project I run a website that facilitates collaborative audio transcription for tin-pot radio station that stopped broadcasting 20 years ago.
This allows people to submit transcriptions in return for charitable donations to their chosen cause.

I just recently relocated back to the UK after spending 7 years living in Berlin, Germany. Berlin continues to be one of my favorite places in the world.
