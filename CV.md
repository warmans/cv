> **tl;dr:** After graduating from Bournemouth University in 2009 I started work as a web developer in a small
> Dorset-based company. I worked primarily on LAMP stack applications for around 3 years but the job
> lacked excitement and challenge so I moved to a backup software startup writing web services and marketing sites
> for about a year. This was an experience but not a sustainable lifestyle so before long I moved to an ad tech 
> (SSP) company called Switch Concepts. Switch was a relatively enjoyable place to work but I didn't see much 
> of a future there and wanted to move away from PHP so at that point (mid 2015) I switch to Go and moved to Berlin to work on for a DSP called Travel Audience. After a year or so at Travel Audience I decided I didn't really enjoy the travel industry and wanted a change from adtech so I moved to fintech company Fraugster to bootstrap their front-end application and have been there since.

> **In Detail:**
>
> At Switch I worked in the majority of the technical departments contributing to core adserving products,
> big data systems, infrastructure and R&D of new products/services. In doing so I have learned a lot about
> the digital advertising industry and enjoy the challenges presented by data-heavy, high volume systems.
> Many of my projects at Switch have required efficient and reliable processing of hundreds of millions of daily
> events using a variety of big data technologies (databases, queues, filesystems etc.) as well as building user
> interfaces capable of displaying the captured data. Additionally I completed a significant number of 
> projects related to modernizing or replacing legacy applications.
>
> At Travelaudience I work primarily as a back-end Go developer on core adserving products. Additionally I do a
> substantial amount of work to maintain and improve orchestration tools (writing Ansible roles, ensuring apps are
> packaged correctly etc). 
>
> At Fraugster I was the first member of a new team responsibile for building out the frontend, backend and infrastructure
> for a new frontend project. The aim was to give customers analytics and configuration options beyond a simple API.
> Over the course of 3+ years I have contined to develop this project as well as taking on more management responsibilities,
> eventually changing my role from full-stack developer to engineering manager. However, despite this role change
> I still spend the majority of my time working directly on the project - coding, debugging, designing new features, running the 
> scrum process and so on.
> We have built out the backend of the application across many Go services leaning heavily on GRPC and Protobuf, Kubernetes, Docker, 
> Postgres and Kafka while the frontend was developed in Typescript with the Angular framework.
