> After graduating from Bournemouth University in 2009 I started work as a web developer in a small
> Dorset-based company. I worked primarily on LAMP stack applications for around 3 years but the job 
> lacked excitement and challenge so I moved to a backup software startup writing web services and marketing sites 
> for about a year. This was an experience but not a sustainable lifestyle so before long I moved to an ad tech
> company called Switch Concepts where I've been for around two years.
>
> At Switch I have worked in the majority of the technical departments contributing to core adserving products,
> big data systems, infrastructure and R&D of new products/services. In doing so I have learned a lot about 
> the digital advertising industry and enjoy the challenges presented by data-heavy, high volume systems.
