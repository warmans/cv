> After graduating from Bournemouth University in 2009 I started work as a web developer in a small
> Dorset-based company. I worked primarily on LAMP stack applications for around 3 years but the job
> lacked excitement and challenge so I moved to a backup software startup writing web services and marketing sites
> for about a year. This was an experience but not a sustainable lifestyle so before long I moved to an ad tech 
> (SSP) company called Switch Concepts. Switch was a relatively enjoyable place to work but I didn't see much 
> of a future there so I decided to try something new. At that point (mid 2015) I moved to Berlin to work on the demand side for a DSP called Travel Audience.
>
> At Switch I worked in the majority of the technical departments contributing to core adserving products,
> big data systems, infrastructure and R&D of new products/services. In doing so I have learned a lot about
> the digital advertising industry and enjoy the challenges presented by data-heavy, high volume systems.
> Many of my projects at Switch have required efficient and reliable processing of hundreds of millions of daily
> events using a variety of big data technologies (databases, queues, filesystems etc.) as well as building user
> interfaces capable of displaying the captured data. Additionally I completed a significant number of 
> projects related to modernizing or replacing legacy applications.
