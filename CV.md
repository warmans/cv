**tl;dr:** *After graduating from University in 2009 I worked in web development for several years, eventually moving to back-end/full-stack roles (ad-tech). In my most recent roles I have been leading development of a large full-stack fin-tech application with Go and Angular, and subsequently moved into a senior role maintaining european payment gateways at Form3.*

**In Detail:**

*Most Recent positions:* 

*At FORM3 I work on European payment service gateways. My Role is primarily back-end development in Go, including general feature development and maintenance. In my time at FORM3 our largest project was to upgrade the SEPA gateways to support the latest ISO20022 maintenance release. This was somewhat challenging as we would have to support both new and old messages for several months, and the gateways had to be refactored significantly to allow for this to happen. Ultimately the project concluded without any incidents and happy customers as a result.*

*At Fraugster I was the first member of a new team responsible for building out the front-end (TypeScript/Angular), back-end (Go) and
infrastructure (K8s) for our "dashboard" project. The objective was to give customers analytics and configuration tools to introspect 
and configure their integration.
This meant creating systems for processing time-series data, raw data storage/life-cycle management, tools for writing business rules
and simulating them across historic data, user management and so on.*
*Over the course of 6+ years I continued to develop this project as well as taking on more management responsibilities,
eventually changing my role from full-stack developer to engineering manager. However, despite this role change
I still spent the majority of my time working directly on the project - coding, debugging, designing new features, running the 
scrum process and so on. After a few years in this role I wanted to move back to development full
time and changed my position to one with technical leadership aspects but mostly development responsibilities.*

*At Travelaudience (Amadeus) I worked primarily as a back-end Go developer on core ad-serving products. Additionally performing a substantial amount of work to maintain and improve orchestration 
tools (writing Ansible roles, ensuring applications were packaged correctly etc). However, 
I didn't stay in this role very long as I didn't find the travel industry to be particularly inspiring.*

## Personal

Outside of work I love to write music and build things (software and physical). I have been into 3d printing and CAD for several years
and have recently started learning CAM with CNC routers. I also enjoy electrical engineering, although I have a long road ahead in this
area. As a side-project I run a website that facilitates collaborative audio transcription for a tin-pot radio station that
stopped broadcasting 20 years ago. This allows people to search and submit transcriptions in return for charitable donations
to their chosen cause, and is considered an essential service for literally almost dozens of people.

I just recently relocated back to the UK after spending 7 years living in Berlin, Germany. Berlin continues to be
one of my favorite places in the world. After initially moving back to the South West, we have since moved to the
Midlands where we plan to continue to live for the forseeable future.
